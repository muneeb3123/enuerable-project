<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 [ Enumerables Enumerables] <a name="about-project"></a>

> The MyList class and MyEnumerable module provide a custom implementation of enumerable methods in Ruby. These components offer a practical demonstration of how classes, modules, and enumerable functionality can be utilized in Ruby programming.

## 🛠 Built With <a name="built-with"></a>

### Tech Stack <a name="tech-stack"></a>

-Ruby: A dynamic, object-oriented programming language known for its simplicity and elegance. Ruby is used as the core language for implementing the MyList class and 
-Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The project leverages the principles of OOP to create the MyList class, encapsulating data and behavior into objects with methods and attributes.
-Enumerable Methods: The project demonstrates the implementation of custom enumerable methods, including all?, any?, and filter, which emulate the behavior of their counterparts in Ruby's built-in Enumerable module.
